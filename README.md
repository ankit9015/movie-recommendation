# movie-recommendation

The movie recommendation app, is a basic web app that suggests some of my favourite movies under different genres.
The program is built using React-JS, HTML and CSS.

This is my second react project, the site is basic but took me a while to built.

I build this project as a part of a slew of projects in Neog.camp level zero curriculum. The program offers minimum hand holding and the available materials are enough to help whenever need arises.

Please visit my portfolio site for other such projects, I'll really appreciate and thank you for your time.
